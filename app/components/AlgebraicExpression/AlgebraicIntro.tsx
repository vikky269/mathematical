      Algebraic expressions are mathematical statements formed by combining variables, constants, and
      arithmetic operations. For example, let us assume that James and Natalie were playing with
      matchsticks and thought of forming number patterns using them. 
      James took four matchsticks and formed the number 4. Natalie added three more matchsticks to form a pattern with two 4's. 
      They realized that they can keep on adding 3 matchsticks in each round to make one extra "four". 
      From this, they concluded that they need 4 + 3(n-1) sticks, in general, to make a pattern with n number of 4's. 
      Here, 4 + 3(n-1) is called an algebraic expression.
