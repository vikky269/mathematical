        Measurement refers to the comparison of an unknown quantity with a known quantity. The result of a measurement is a numeric value with certain units. We can measure the length, mass, capacity (volume), and temperature of any given object. Let us learn more about the measurement chart, measurement conversion and the units of measurement in this article.

      <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">What is Measurement?</h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Measurement is defined as the system or act of measuring. It can be understood as a process of defining physical items using numbers. For example, 'this rod is bigger than that rod'. This statement is serving a very limited purpose of comparison where we do not know anything about the individual attributes of the given rods.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        However, if we say that the length of the first rod is 20 inches, and the length of the second rod is 15 inches, we understand that the 1st rod is bigger than the second one by 5 inches. This statement is making more sense mathematically and offers us a reason for our deduction.

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In mathematics, measurement is often considered as a separate branch as it includes a wide range of knowledge including conversion, units, measuring length, mass, time, etc. It is associated with other branches as well like geometry, trigonometry, algebra, etc.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        We use the concept of measurement with the shapes (area, volume, etc). Measuring heights and distances using trigonometric ratios is also a type of measurement (trigonometry). Measurement can also be done using unknown quantities or variables to establish a general relationship (algebra).
      </p>

        Now, before learning about measurement units, let us learn the abbreviations that are generally used to represent units of measurement.
